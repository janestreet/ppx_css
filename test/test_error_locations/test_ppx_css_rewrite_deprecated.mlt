Error: The use of ~rewrite is deprecated, please use ~dont_hash or ~dont_hash_prefixes
       instead. Alternatively, consider writing all of your CSS in the same %css
       stylesheet incantation. Deprecating ~rewrite allows for more optimiztions in ppx_css,
       at the expense of expressibility. We've audited bonsai apps and believe this expressibility
       was unused so we've removed it. If this conflicts with your use case please reach out.
