(* This pattern allows us to choose the order in which the tokenizers are applied. Sedlex 
   does not really honor the ordering of the match arms within its ppx match statement, so
   this is a way around that.

   This also allows us to somewhat split the code into modules. Unfortunately due to how
   sedlex works, we have to redeclare some of the regexes, but the code is much more readable
   without us having to sift through 100 lines of regexes in a single file.

   Note that this pattern is slightly less efficient, as it creates multiple automata that 
   the lexer has to step through in order to find the matching token, but it should only be
   marginally less efficient.
